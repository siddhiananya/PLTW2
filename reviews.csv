dustinw,This model of headphones seems to continue to be the best in class in all areas. The superb noise canceling, great audio quality and excellent features easily put it in front of all other models. I use these for trips and while I work in the office, and they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and have become a must for me on plane rides, with their noise canceling. I can't recommend these enough.,5,6/14/2022,Verified
Grlg33k,The best set I have ever owned. The sound quality is amazing. The comfort is top notch, even while wearing glasses and earrings! The noise canceling is fantastic. The battery life has been great too. Love these so much!,5,8/31/2022,Verified
Hanish,Loved it, it's really good quality and it has all the features but one problem is that if you want to use the headphones via the audio jack the sound quality levels down from like 10 to 0.5, it's like listening to a 25 dollar headphones, besides that the actual quality of music when we switch it on and use is awesome. Don't forget to connect it to the app it gives you most of the listening styles and quality variations.,5,2/13/2024,Verified
DayG,These headphones are very comfortable, have really great sound, and the noise-cancelling is awesome once it starts. It takes a couple of seconds for the headphones to analyze the ambient noise, but once it starts its noise cancellation it does a really good job. The app is pretty intuitive, although I'm unsure how much the ear analysis does. I've yet to experience the directional sound. I upgraded my nugs.net just to try this feature, but either they have not yet encoded the music to make use of the technology, or the technology simply doesn't work. But in all honesty these are stilll great headphones.,5,2/29/2024,Verified
Lorenzo,I'm an Apple fan, but I couldn't justify the price and weight of the AirPods Max. I used the WH-1000XM2 for many years, and the WH-1000XM5 are better in (almost) everything: great sound quality, noise cancellation, design, light weight, incredible battery life. The only downside for me compared to the older model is that they don't fold, therefore the case is very big and it's more inconvenient to travel with them.,5,10/24/2023,Verified

Rocco P,These headphones are outstanding for sound, noise cancelling, and battery life. Unlike all previous headphones I have owned, these cannot be used while charging. This can be a little annoying if the battery dies when I have 10 minutes left in a movie. Fortunately, they charge very quickly. It is disappointing that the app only works on a cell phone. I use these primarily with my computers and TV, so I cannot take advantage of all the features that might be available through a phone. The build quality is rather flimsy. The padding on the headband started peeling off at 2 months, and the right unit snapped off at 3 months (today), making them useless. As one of the most expensive headsets in this category, I expected something a littl...,3,1/25/2023,Verified
Brandon,My package arrived with the box broken or torn open. Headphones that cost hundreds of dollars were clearly visible. There was minimal packing materials inside to protect the product. It's hard to verify whether I even received a new item because of the condition of the shipment. It's a miracle I got to the package in my lobby before someone grabbed the headphones straight out of the box. Yes, packages get damaged in transit, but quality packing is a huge part of deterring that. It's also a choice to use FedEx. Just know that your stuff might not arrive correct. Might be safer to purchase from a different seller.,2,9/19/2023,Verified
Nikhil,Box itself look old product .Didn't liked it,1,12/3/2023,Verified
Jocelyn,This is a gift for someone how can I give this to someone when it's really dirty that's why apple is better.,1,12/18/2023,Verified
Chaithanya,These headphones have enabled me to do household tasks and be on calls without the other person complaining of the noises. Before this I often had to stop doing such tasks due to complaints of disturbances. The main reason for this being rated 4 and not 5 is because it is not comfortable to wear continuously for over 2 hours. I am able to wear my Sony WHCH700N for up to 5 hours comfortably and expected the same with these new ones too.,4,8/15/2023,Verified
FeliciaH,These headphones have great sound and superb bass response. They also have excellent noise cancelling. The one major flaw is with the earpads. If I am wearing my glasses (which I do the majority of my waking hours) while listening to these headphones I get this rubbing/squeaking nose if I walking around or moving around or eating. This also happens when I use the headphones on Zoom calls whenever I talk. It's bearable for the most part but it definitely gets annoying after a while.,4,1/16/2024,Verified
DoubleAA,I like these a lot. They fit my needs. They sound good. Connect with my devices. Have an app that I can customize settings. Are comfortable. Have a number of useful features that work for me like the different levels of pass through sound. I use these daily on walks, at work, or just around the house. If I could have one feature it would be for the cup to rotate down instead of up when around my neck. All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.,5,1/16/2024,Verified
Knorris,I bought these a month ago and love them! My Beats headphones snapped trying to put them on my head and I never feel that fear when I'm about to put them on so love the design. The sound quality is really good with the exception of max volume (those around you can hear) but for your hearing, you probably shouldn't listen to anything at max volume. Since buying these I've worn them to work out, commute in, and listen to music while I work. Overall, I would recommend these to anyone looking for good noise-cancelling headphones.,5,1/28/2024,Verified
Aly,Well I'm going to buy the 77 inch Sony TV in March so I thought I would purchase these headphones because they will be able to match up and I can hear attach them or connect to the TV and able to adjust the sound in my headphones, so I have been using these to listen to music and the sound and quality is unbelievable. I am very happy with my purchase.,5,1/25/2024,Verified
Amanda,I recently ruptured my eardrum and I was told I can't wear in ear headphone anymore. So far I really like these headphone! I live in a city and work in an office. After a few days they automatically adjust to ambient sound when walking( so I can hear things around me ) and then noise canceling at my office. They are on the larger side and don't compact for storage which I don't love but is common for the overhead style. They have a long battery life and great sound. You do need to download an app for more settings.,4,1/31/2024,Verified
